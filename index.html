        <p>Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is a multiplayer first-person shooter game developed and published by Valve Corporation.<br> It is the sequel to the 1996 mod Team Fortress for Quake and its 1999 remake, Team Fortress Classic.<br> It was released as part of the video game bundle The Orange Box in October 2007 for Microsoft Windows and the Xbox 360.<br> A PlayStation 3 version followed in December 2007. The game was released for Windows in April 2008 and was updated to support OS X in June 2010 and Linux in February 2013.<br> It is distributed online through Valve's digital retailer Steam, with retail distribution by Electronic Arts.<br>

            Players join one of two teams comprising nine character classes, battling in a variety of game modes including capture the flag and king of the hill.<br> Development is led by John Cook and Robin Walker, creators of the original Team Fortress. Announced in 1998, the game once had more realistic, militaristic visuals and gameplay,<br> but this changed over the protracted nine-year development.

C. Leyendecker, Dean Cornwell, and Norman Rockwell, and uses Valve's Source game engine.<br></p>
